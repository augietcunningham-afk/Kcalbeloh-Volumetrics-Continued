# Kcalbeloh-Volumetrics-Continued
This is a update to another mod, made by me to keep the visuals of the amazing mod Kcalbeloh relevant. It edits another user's mod, and fixes it to work with the latest version of Kcalbeloh, and the second latest version of Volumetric Clouds by BlackRack, EVE Volumetrics Release 4. The mod is made originally by ProximaCentauriStar, and has likely been abandoned. I am using her code under the creative commons/MIT license. No copies of paid content are included in this mod, as that is illegal. If you want to use this mod, you must subscribe to BlackRacks patreon. You only need to do this once for access to all builds of Volumetric Clouds.

INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS:

Enter the Kcalbeloh Volumetrics folder once downloaded. Drag the KcalbelohSystem folder into your gamedata, and click replace files if asked to do so.

Here is the link to the original: https://github.com/ProximaCentauri-star/KcalebelohVolumetrics Here is a link to BlackRack's patreon: https://www.patreon.com/posts/true-volumetric-94613561 And, here is a link to Kcalbeloh System: https://github.com/jcyuan06/Kcalbeloh-System/releases/tag/v1.1.8

I highly recommend using deferred rendering with Parallax continued. Links to these are included below, but follow the install instructions. https://github.com/LGhassen/Deferred https://github.com/Gameslinx/Parallax-Continued

In order for Parallax to work with Kcalbeloh, you must download Kcalbeloh Parallax, linked in the Parallax repo.

Feel free to edit and use these however you may wish, as long as you don't sell these configs, as that is illegal. :)
